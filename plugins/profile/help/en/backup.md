# Character Backup

Ares supports a fast-and-easy way to back up your important character information.  

> If you're looking for help with game backups instead, see [Backups](https://aresmush.com/tutorials/manage/backups.html).

The character backup includes things like:

* Character sheet
* Background
* Description
* Info

You can generate an in-game backup that can be logged to a file, or a set of files to download from the web portal.

`backup` - Generate a backup file that you can download from the web portal.
`backup/game` - Output text from the MU client that you can log to a file.
